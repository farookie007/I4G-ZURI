      <h2>The Legend of KOBE BRYANT, <em>the highschool kid who challenged the gods of the game</em></h2>
      <p>
        On January 26, 2020; as the world was battling with the Covid-19 pandemic, the world of sports received a devastating news of the death of basketball legend, <strong>KOBE BRYANT</strong>.

        Kobe Bean Bryant was a professional American Basketball player and the shooting guard of the <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong> team in the <strong><abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr></strong>. He's arguably one of the best players to ever play the game of basketball, his life was a memorable one as he was priviledged to play with many other great names in the league. He loved the competition that comes with every game and rather than feeling intimidated as a rookie, he faced the challenges heads-on. He played with so much determination and focus that he was never looked down upon as a rookie, during his prime and until his last professional game in which he scored a whooping 60 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was one of the greatest players of the <abbr title="Los Angeles Lakers">L.A Lakers</abbr>. Despite having great players like <strong>Shaquille O'Neal</strong> on his team, he has the most appearances in the <abbr title="National Baskteball Association">NBA</abbr> as a starter. He has played with other great players like <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>, <strong>Shaquille O'Neal</strong>, <strong>Yao Ming</strong>, <strong>Lebron James</strong>, <strong>Ray Allen</strong>, e.t.c. He was the first player to ever dunk on Houston Rockets' center, Yao Ming who has a record of not ever being postered. Also the second player with highest points in a single NBA game with 81 points, second to Wilt Chamberlain's 100 points game.
      </p>

      <h3>My Favorite Quotes</h3>
      <blockquote>
        I'll do whatever it takes to win games, whether it's sitting on a bench waving a towel, handing a cup of water to a teammate, or hitting the game-winning shot.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        As I sit here now, when I take off my shoe and I look down at my scar, I see beauty in it. I see all the hard work, all the sacrifices. I see the journey that it took to get back to this point of being healthy. And I see beauty in that struggle. That's what makes it beautiful
